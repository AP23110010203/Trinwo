**PORTFOLIO BUILDER FOR DEVELOPERS**



**Description**
the summer internship project “Portfolio Maker For Developers”, developed as a practical solution for users to quickly create personalized digital portfolios.
With the increasing importance of having an online professional presence, the objective was to automate portfolio creation using resume extraction and templating. The project bridges the gap between static resumes and modern web-based portfolios.
The motivation behind this project stems from the time-consuming and technical nature of creating a digital portfolio manually. By introducing resume parsing, we aimed to simplify this process and make it accessible to everyone.
